# sugoku's KiCad footprints

These are footprints which I made after not being able to find them anywhere else, or needing an open-source version. These footprints are generated with Python and the scripts are included in each folder.

## LICENSE NOTES
Everything is licensed under the MIT License. If you distribute Gerber files or pictures of a PCB with these footprints, you do not need to credit me, but it would be cool if you did :)
